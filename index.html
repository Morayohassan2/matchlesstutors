        <p>I offered MTH 132(calculus & geometry) in my year 1.
          This course was a very difficult course but it was made very simple by Mr. Nedu Remy founder of Matchless Tutors, I
          hereby recommend him as the best maths tutor to anyone out there with similar challenge.</li>

<p>There are teachers and there is A TEACHER!

  <p>I was opportune to be lectured by Mr Nedu Remy, during my preparation for the WAEC
examinations. In little words, it was a rather superb learning experience. His technique was
engaging and unambiguous. I struggled greatly with maths but he helped me and I have
my WAEC scores to show for it. Due to his teachings, I went from an E student in maths to a B
student. I would recommend him anywhere and anytime to anyone looking to see real improvements
in their academics</p>
